# Contributing to create-looker-extension

ðŸŽ‰ Before we dive in... Thank you for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the create-looker-extension generator. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Community Guidelines

This project follows [Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

We've created a sample "Developer Checklist" that populates in every new pull request that'll help make your PR great.

## Developer Setup

To develop locally, simply run

```
./index.js your-project-name
```

from within the root directory, rather than the `npm init` command. Everything else should be identical.

### Bug Reports

Bugs from the community are tracked in [Github Issues](https://github.com/looker-open-source/create-looker-extension/issues).

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue
- Describe how to reproduce the problem
  - Bonus points for specific error text
- Explain the behavior your were expecting
- Label your issue with "bug"

## Enhancements Requests

Enhancements Requests from the community are also tracked in [Github Issues](https://github.com/looker-open-source/create-looker-extension/issues).

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue
- Describe what you want to be able to accomplish
- Label your issue with "enhancement"

### Title Guidelines

We squash Pull Requests (all commits in a pull request show up in our `main` branch history as a single commit) and we use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to generate our CHANGELOG.

So we use Conventional Commit style Pull Request titles:

`<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

Examples:

```
fix(BrowserSession): Fixed issue with Oauth flow
feat(NewComponentName): Component to support exciting new thing
chore(deps): Updated package dependency X from version y to z
```

#### Types

We generally follow [Angular's types](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type). The most common types used are:

- fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
- feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature or changes an existing one (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).

If a change does _NOT_ make a change to the build artifacts produced (`fix` or `feat` above) you can also use one of these alternative types:

- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- docs: Documentation only changes
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

#### Scope

Specify a scope when your change is focused on a specific component, package, or portion of the code. E.g.:

```
fix(React+Typescript): React + Typescript generation now builds a correct package.json
```

### Developer Checklist

Edit the developer checklist to reflect only items relevant to your pull request (delete items that aren't relevant). Feel free to reach out if you have questions or get stuck.

Not sure if an item applies? Leave it in place and ask your reviewer to help determine if it's relevant.

Thank you for opening a Pull Request! Before submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:

- [ ] Make sure to open an issue as a [bug/issue](https://github.com/looker-open-source/create-looker-extension/issues/new/choose) before writing your code! That way we can discuss the change, evaluate designs, and agree on the general idea
- [ ] Ensure the tests and linter pass
- [ ] Appropriate docs were updated (if necessary)
